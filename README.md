# handy-arguments-library
Library of links to documentation and research for when in an argument. Doesn't need to only support 'one' side, but should be proper research. Less time used on trolls, more time informing people.

# library and template for library
In addition to the library, create one or more templates to easier create new parts to the library.

# Social media as a discussion platform
Social medias are mostly not good tools to discuss if you're more than just a handful of people. Maybe GitHub's "build upon other's work" will be better, and lead to more sober discussions about changes to the library.
